**How to Develop Card Bodies Without GPT Writing for You**

1. **Prepare the card header**

   * Write Title and one-sentence Summary on a blank card.
   * Leave the Body field empty.

2. **Generate an outline using GPT**

   * Provide GPT only the Title and Summary.
   * Request 3–5 bullet points expanding the Summary.

3. **Ask for probing questions**

   * For each outline bullet, prompt GPT for 2–3 questions that challenge assumptions, require evidence, or clarify relationships.

4. **Answer questions yourself**

   * Write brief answers in your own words.

5. **Identify gaps with GPT**

   * Send answers and the outline to GPT.
   * Ask GPT to list missing points or logical gaps.

6. **Draft Body paragraphs**

   * Write one paragraph per outline bullet.
   * Use active voice.

7. **Iterate with targeted GPT feedback**

   * Give GPT your draft and the outline.
   * Ask it to flag unclear, unsupported, or redundant sentences.
   * Revise as needed.

8. **Add examples and counter-examples**

   * Request analogies or counter-examples.
   * Select only those that clarify, discard the rest.

9. **Final alignment check**

   * Ask GPT to summarize how well the Body aligns with the Summary.
   * Adjust text until you are satisfied with the match.

10. **Commit and integrate**

    * Hand-write the final Body on your card.
    * Register it digitally; tag the card “integrated.”

**Daily Process**

1. Empty the capture inbox.
2. For each entry, decide: discard, or create a card (idea or literature).
3. Generate ID (optionally under a parent).
4. Fill Title, Summary, and Tags; outline Body.
5. Add Context and Next action.
6. Register using `cards.py register`.
7. Confirm with `cards.py show`.

**Weekly Process**

1. Run `cards.py list` to view recent cards.
2. For every card older than 7 days, ensure:

   * At least one Link or SequenceNext
   * Sufficient tags
3. Link orphans; sequence derived ideas.
4. Convert literature insights into idea cards.
5. Write a synthesis paragraph for all cards tagged “pending”; then tag as “integrated.”
6. Verify backups and review the index for consistency.
